                    <p>This was a convention held at Singapore Suntec City where game developers show up to share exchanges with one another and play test games. </p>>
                    <p>I informed this with some of my classmates to see the local games being developed by people of my age. </p>
                    <p>There, I was acquainted with a student from Singapore Polytechnic that was developing his own game. </p>

                    <p>In September of 2023, I was lucky to be selected for a overseas trip with the course to visit the Tokyo Game Show. </p>
                    <p>In a 8 Day trip, I visited game companies such as Bandai Namco and Creek and River co. </p>
                    <p>Among the events, one of the highlights was the Tokyo Game Show, one of the largest game conventions annually. </p>
                    <p>There, I playtested some of the games and shared exchanges with the developers. </p>
                    <span>One of my biggest surprises was play testing a rhythm game, on a controller, I never thought that could be possible but it had proven me otherwise </span>
                    <span>that a Rhythm game can indeed even be played on controllers. </span>
