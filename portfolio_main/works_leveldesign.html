                    <span></span>
                    <p><b>Purpose :</b> 2D level design for platformers </p>
                    <p><b>Team :</b> 1 people </p>
                    <p><b>Software :</b> Mario Editor</p>

                    <br>
                    <span>A school assignment, this is 1 of 3 levels that I designed using Mario maker. </span>
                    <span>In this level, we were tasked to introduce a new power up and designed a mario level that is around 3 minutes. </span>
                    <span>This was also supposed to be the final level, meaning it had to be the most difficult among the 3 levels. </span>

                    <br><br>
                    <span>With all this in mind, I planned my level and introduced new challenging enemies that would synergise with </span>
                    <span>the new power up mechanics that i was going to teach. </span>
                    <span>I spaced the level, ensuring there are downtimes for the player to rest after completing challenges. </span>
                    <span>There were about 10 iterations of the level at the very least after I collected playtest results and feedback on my players. </span>

                    <span>At the first area where I introduce the power up, I force the player to duck, teaching them how to use it. </span>
                    <span>The shell also makes the player invulnerable to damage hence the spikes, and it also permanently kill undead enemies. </span>
                    <span>In this level, I introduce enemies that are immune to stomping, further bringing out the utility of this power up. </span>

                    <span>In the reference image, I layed 2 paths for the player, one path is a straight line </span>

                    <span>The second route has the player to need to jump up and dodge the enemy. </span>

                    <span>and the boos prevents them from going back, making it like a high speed chase for the player. </span>
                    <span>This would give the player an andrenaline rush for the final section. </span>

                    <span>The 3 boos does not increase the difficulty by a lot as players are already familiar with dodging them. </span>
                    <span>These kind of chase has an unseen timer effect on the player as any sloppy and slow movements will be punished. </span>

                    <span>This is one of my more challenging twists near the end of the level.  </span>
                    <span>The boo circle rotates in a loop, the player has to time their jump to get in and out of the circle. </span>
                    <span>While inside the circle, there is a conveyer belt pushing the player forward off the cliff. </span>
                    <span>Hence, to not fall off, the player has to move backwards. However, each time they move backwards, the giant boo </span>
                    <span>will get closer and closer to the player. </span>
                    <span>The player has to find the timing to jump out of the boo circle as swiftly as possible before the Giant Boo gets them. </span>
                    <br><br>
                    <span>However, one unintended player action I recorded from playtest is that some players will just ignore the timing </span>
                    <span>and speed through this section taking one damage. This is because players have 3 hearts and have seconds of immunity when they take damage. </span>
                    <span>Perhaps one improvement would be to place this section at the end of the level, so that players that have already taken damage, cannot risk to speed through this and ignore the challenge. </span>

                    <span>Compared to 2D level design, 3D design now requires good use of camera and lighting to direct the player and </span>

                    <span>space design too can have a big impact of player's actions: a narrow and cramped space fits horror themed games, where large open areas </span>

                    <h3>Design Intentions</h3>
                    <span>After the player finally has the laser gun. Once again, I set up a open area filled with ranged enemies to utilise the power of the laser gun. </span>
                    <span>The section is very long in length and filled with obstacles to prevent the player from taking out every enemy from the start. </span>
                    <span>They have to travel from cover to cover, taking out enemies along the way. I also introduce a explosive robot enemy which blows up at close range, </span>
                    <span>this makes the long range weapon more prefavourable. </span>
